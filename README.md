# 4170-Trading-Challenge
Coding challenge for 4170 Trading

There are 3 files containing the solutions to each of the problems in the exercise: Problem1.py, Problem2.py, and Problem3.py.

Problem1 can be run using command "python Problem1.py". The target value is filled in as 500, as per the problem description. However, it is possible to test this dynamic programming algorithm with any target value. The result is printed at the end.

Problem 2 uses the built-in itertools module. There is a helper function called permuations that uses the product method from itertools to calculate the number of permuations for each sum made by the two types of dice. The program can be run using the command "python Problem2.py". The result is printed at the end.

Problem 3 uses the munkres module, which implements the Munkres/Hungarian algorithm. It is necessary to install this package to run the code. To run the file, use "python Problem3.py". The result is printed at the end.

Each exercise was done in Python 3.
